There are two ways to program:
  -Procedural Programming
  -Object Oriented Programming
  
-Explanations-
Procedural Programming:  Read the program instructions line by line, starting at the top going down until the end, much like how we read.
    Move LeftArm out directly over beer can;
    Open LeftHand;
    Move LeftArm down until it touches the table;
    Close LeftHand;
    Return Left arm to original starting position;
    
        Makes sense, right?  Program name: Grab_That_Beer.c
        The C programming language is Procedural.
        
Object Oriented Programming:  It's possible to use an Object Oriented Programming language in a procedural way, but it's not designed to
be used like that and it's not efficient at all.

I think of OOP like this.  In Windows File Explorer you can make a new text file, right?  Right click your new file and what you see are
