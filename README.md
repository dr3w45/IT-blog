+--IT Explanations for the Common Man--+

Iv'e researched Cyber Security related things for years now and not once have I came across an article that did't overcomplicate the already complicated subject
that I was trying to wrap my head around.

These explanations hopefully save somebody alot of time trying to understand the basics of these subjects.  I keep it simple because before I learn a subject, 
or new concept (like Object Oriented Programming or SMB shares or Encryption) I first need to understand it as a whole.  What it does, why it exists, and maybe the problem\s it solves.
This understanding ususally gives me the guard rails I need to correctly learn it.

I don't expect anybody to actually read this.
